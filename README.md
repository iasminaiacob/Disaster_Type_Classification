# Disaster_Type_Classification
Disaster Type Classification from UAV Imagery

The C2A dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rgbnihal/c2a-dataset) was used for this project, creating 4 types of disasters, along with the Resisc45 (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/resisc45) dataset, which adds one more class - "no disaster". I preprocessed the dataset locally, uploaded the processed data onto Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/iasminaiacob/disaster-classif), and then loaded it into Google Colab. The model creation and training was done in Colab, as per DisasterC2A.ipynb.
